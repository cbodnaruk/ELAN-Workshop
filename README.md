## Background to documentary linguistics
### Goals



## Overview of practical session
The practical component of this workshop will be divided into two parts:
- Recording
- ELAN

The recording part will cover the practise of recording linguistic data in the field, including the technical aspects of digital audio, as well as best practises in sorting and maintaining useable and useful data.
The second part will introduce the software [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), used for annotating and transcribing recorded data. It will cover the installation and setup of ELAN, the initial processing of data in ELAN, and ultimately the practical transcription of recorded data for analysis.
