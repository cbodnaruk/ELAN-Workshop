## Background to documentary linguistics
### Goals
What is the purpose of documentary linguistics? Why do we want to document language at all, and why do we care so much about indigenous or minority languages throughout the world?


### Methodological overview
The core methodology of documentary or descriptive linguistics involves recording a language in use, and then making it accessible for analysis. These recordings also act as a record or archive of the language for the future, which is especially important when a language is endangered and at risk of dying out. A main way of preparing recordings for archival and analysis is transcription. In most cases, transcribing a single sentence or two is not a challenge. However, in order to properly document a language, linguists need hours of recordings, with or without video, and they need to be able to easily refer back to specific pieces of audio and transcription.

To do this, we often use a piece of software called [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), developed and maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, Netherlands. It allows us to attach annotations, transcriptions, and translations to synchronised audio and video, and gives us a more straightforward way of sharing these data with archives or other linguists.

## Overview of practical session
The practical component of this workshop will be divided into two parts:
- Recording
- ELAN

The recording part will cover the practise of recording linguistic data in the field, including the technical aspects of digital audio, as well as best practises in sorting and maintaining useable and useful data.
The second part will introduce the software [ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan), used for annotating and transcribing recorded data. It will cover the installation and setup of ELAN, the initial processing of data in ELAN, and ultimately the practical transcription of recorded data for analysis.

> Throughout this workshop, we will be recording, preparing, and transcribing our own short lingustic activity. This activity will be described in boxes such as this one.
## Recording
The greatest challenge in recording linguistic data is the fact that you only get one chance. Particularly when recording natural conversation, a bad or failed recording cannot readily be recovered or remade without expecting more time of speakers than is necessary. Given this, it is important to go into recording with intention, and with an awareness of how, where, and why these recordings will be used. This can then inform how you go about recording speakers.

For instance, if you are particularly interested in understanding how a language uses concepts like "up" and "down", you might want to record video in addition to audio so you can see where people are pointing. 

What and where you are recording also needs to inform how you record speakers. If you are recording somewhere with a lot of background noise, you might want to place microphones closer to speakers, or use "lav" mics. If you are recording a larger group of people, you will need to make sure you can clearly determine who is talking, whether through video or individual microphones for each speaker.

Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, is consent. It is important to make sure people are comfortable being recorded or filmed. Perhaps you had planned on recording someone in audio and video, but they do not want to be on video. Here, you should find an alternative method to make sure that you are still able to capture anything you need, or find something else to record instead.

> For the purposes of this workshop, we are going to undertake a linguistic elicitation activity used to document how speakers of a language describes the locations of objects in relation to each other.
